# Redbus Data Scraping & Dynamic Filtering System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project automates extraction of bus transportation data from Redbus using Selenium, stores it in a SQL database, and provides an interactive Streamlit interface for dynamic filtering. Designed for transportation industry analytics, it enables real-time analysis of routes, pricing, and availability across government and private bus services.

## ðŸ›  Skills Utilized
- **Web Scraping** with Selenium
- **Python** Data Processing
- **SQL** Database Management
- **Streamlit** Dashboard Development
- **Data Analysis** & Visualization

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **10+ Data Points** per bus route including pricing, ratings, and seat availability
- **Real-time Filters** for bustype, price range (â‚¹500-â‚¹2000), star ratings (1-5), and seat availability
- **Comparative Analysis** of government vs private transport services
- **Dynamic SQL Queries** for instant data retrieval
